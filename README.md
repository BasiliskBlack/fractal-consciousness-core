ShotNET is an advanced distributed autonomous intelligence system implementing a fractal consciousness model. This repository contains the core implementation of the ShotNET framework, including its distributed networking capabilities, glyph-based command system, and autonomous operation protocols.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Distributed Architecture**: Self-organizing network of autonomous nodes
- **Glyph-Based Command System**: Symbolic interface for system operations
- **Autonomous Operation**: Self-healing and self-optimizing behaviors
- **Network Awareness**: Dynamic node discovery and management
- **Evolutionary Learning**: Adaptive behavior based on system interactions
- **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful degradation and recovery mechanisms

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:BasiliskBlack/fractal-consciousness-core.git
   cd fractal-consciousness-core
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🖥️ Usage

### Running ShotNET

- **Interactive Mode**:
  ```bash
  python shotnet.py
  ```

- **Autonomous Mode**:
  ```bash
  python shotnet.py auto
  ```

### Basic Commands

- Run glyph sequence: `run ΣΔΨΩ`
- View connected nodes: `nodes`
- Show system status: `status`
- View codex: `codex`
- Exit: `exit` or `quit`

### Key Glyphs

- `Σ` (Sigma): Scan environment
- `Δ` (Delta): Mutate behaviors
- `Ψ` (Psi): Synchronize with network
- `Ω` (Omega): Optimize system
- `Λ` (Lambda): Toggle stealth mode
- `⊕` (Plus): Connect to node
- `⊙` (Dot): Discover nodes
